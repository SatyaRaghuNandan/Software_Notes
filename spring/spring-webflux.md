Spring WebFlux
---
 
Spring WebFlux is fully non-blocking framework, supports Reactive Streams back pressure, and runs on servers such as Netty, Undertow, and Servlet 3.1+ containers.

Spring WebFlux supports two types of programming models :

1. Traditional annotation-based model with `@Controller`, `@RequestMapping`, and other annotations that you have been using in Spring MVC.

2. A brand new Functional style model based on Java 8 lambdas for routing and handling requests.
